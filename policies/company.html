The JAF should detail job profile for informing the students about the company's requirements.</li><li>The relevant content of the JAF is electronically broadcasted to all the students along with the other additional information furnished by the company</li><li>The company can ask for the resumes of interested students and has the liberty to shortlist them before beginning of the placement process.</li><li>The company will be allotted slots and dates (<a href="../media/uploads/calendar.pdf">Placement Calendar</a>) for conducting Pre-Placement Talk (PPT)/Written Test/Online Test with a request to confirm the same by a specified date. On failing to do so, the allotted slot may be given to other companies on their request. Request for any change in the slot can be entertained subject to its availability.</li><li>The final placement process (Group Discussion (GD)/Interview) is slotted from December 01, 2023 onwards with further details given below:<ol><li>December 01, 2023 - December 04, 2023: Two Interview-slots/day<ol><li>Slot 1 : 08:00 AM - 03:00 PM</li><li>Slot 2 : 05:00 PM - 12:00 AM</li></ol>Results for slot 1 and slot 2 will be declared at 03:00 PM and 12:00 AM respectively.</li><li>December 05, 2023 onwards: Only one slot from 5:00 PM to 12:00 AM. Written / Online Tests will be permitted only when it does not clash with the schedule of interviews of the other companies.</li></ol></li><li>TPC generally allots a date and a slot to the company for the final placement process based on the following criteria:<ol><li>Job profile and growth prospects</li><li>CTC being offered by the company (CTC and Take-Home)</li><li>Past records of recruitment</li><li>Conduct of Pre Placement Talks/Written Test/Online Test before final placement (as mentioned in point [5] above)</li><li>Internship offered for pre-final year students.</li><li>Feedback from the students/alumni regarding the company</li></ol></li><li>TPC advises the companies to conduct the PPT much before the final placement commences. This will provide ample time to the students for making a considered decision in joining the company.</li><li>In case a company finds it inconvenient to visit the campus twice for going through its complete selection process, it may be allowed to carry out its entire selection process,including PPT, on a mutually agreed date, but from December 5, 2023 onwards.</li><li>The list of shortlisted students for the final placement process is to be mailed to the TPC by the company prior to December 01, 2023.</li><li>A student will be allowed to appear for at most four companies in a single slot on any day. The student(s) shortlisted by you may not be available for the interviews. Besides a student shortlisted by you might have earned a job prior to yours scheduled slot for the final placement process. TPC will provide a comprehensive list of such students to the company before its scheduled slot. For this reason, you are advised to maintain an extended list of shortlisted students to have makeup against the dropout. It will help you to choose the right candidate from a sizeable lot.</li><li>In case the company's process exceeds the time of their allotted slot, their results will be declared along with the results of the companies scheduled in the next slot (as detailed in clause 5 above).</li><li>The final selection is not to be disclosed to the students directly. The results are to be submitted to the TPC by the end of the assigned slot in a sealed envelope and the TPC will be informing the concerned students. Students with multiple offers will be required to finalize their option within half an hour from the end of the slot and have to inform TPC of the same. His/her choice would be informed to all the concerned companies. In this situation, to ensure that the company does not suffer on the front of recruitment, the company is suggested to prepare a list of students, in order of their merit, who can be kept waitlisted. Any drop out from the main-list will enable movement of the waitlisted candidates to the list of selected candidates and the company will be informed of the same.</li><li>The company may also, if interested, conduct selections for summer internship during their visit. Internship Policy along with Placement Calendar can be referred for this purpose.</li><li>It is important to understand that, on the same date, another company may be scheduled before/after your slot and any shift is bound to cause inconvenience to yourself and others as well. Therefore, you should visit the campus on scheduled dates and conduct the Written/Online test/GD/Interview during the slot assigned to you.</li><li>The duration of first round of interview for a candidate should not exceed 45 minutes in one go and 1 hour 30 minutes put together. There has to be a time gap of at least 45 minutes between two rounds of interviews.</li><li>The Institute follows "One Student, One Job" policy. Low paid jobs that are from IT companies recruiting 50 or more students are not counted towards this. Job opportunities from Government/PSUs will also be made available to all the students who are not already placed in a PSU. Once a student is offered a job in the PSUs/Government, he/she will not be allowed to sit for any further campus recruitment drive and will decline any other job he/she might have earned from campus.</li><li>As an exception to the "One Student, One Job" policy, a student who has secured a job, say from a company can appear for the placement procedure of another company if he/she is allowed for the same by the Professor Incharge, Training and Placement Cell. The discretion of the Professor Incharge of TPC should be final in this regard.</li><li>The company is required to send offer letters to TPC, who will then hand it over to the concerned students. Such letters are expected to reach the cell before March 31, 2024.</li></ol><a class="btn btn-md btn-primary" href="../media/uploads/placement_policy_company.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to Download the aforementioned Placement Policy (as PDF)</a><p></p></div><div class="tab-pane fade" id="internship" role="tabpanel"><ol><li>The Undergraduate Students are required to undergo summer training for duration of minimum 6 weeks during the summer vacation after completion of 6 semesters for B.Tech. students and 6/8 semesters for IDD students. M.Tech/M.Pharma students can proceed for 2 semester internships and after completing their first year.</li><li>The company shall fill up the Internship Announcement Form (IAF) and submit it to the Training and Placement Cell (TPC) as an e-mail attachment to tpo@iitbhu.ac.in or in the form of a hard copy. IAF serves to introduce to the candidates about the company's internship profile, requirements etc.</li><li>The IAF is electronically broadcasted to the concerned students along with all the other relevant information furnished by the company.</li><li>The company can ask for the resumes of interested students and has the liberty to shortlist them at any stage of the intern selection process.</li><li>The company will be allotted dates (<a href="../media/uploads/calendar.pdf">Placement Calendar</a>) for conducting Pre–Placement Talk (PPT)/Written Test/Online Test, with a request to confirm the same by a specified date. On failing to do so, the allotted date may be given to other companies on their requests. Request for any change in the date can be entertained subject to its availability.</li><li>The company visits the campus on scheduled dates and conducts the Written/Online Test/GD/Interview as part of their intern selection procedure during the time frame assigned to them. Internship offers are not to be disclosed to the students and the final selection results are to be submittedto the TPC in a sealed envelope or communicated by an email. Students with multiple offers will be generally required to finalize their option and inform TPC by 12 noon of the next working day. The students’ choice would be informed to the concerned companies. However, in some cases where the company is looking for this information urgently, the concerned students will be informed electronically to exercise their option by the time specified therein. To ensure a safety against dropout, the company is suggested to prepare a list of students, in order of their merit, who can be keptwaitlisted. Any drop out from the main - list will enable movement of the waitlisted candidates to the list of selected candidates and the company will be informed of the same.</li><li>The Institute follows "One Student One Internship" policy.</li><li>The company is required to send offer letters to the TPC, which will then hand them over to the concerned students. Such letters, hard or soft copy, are expected to reach the TPC before March 31, 2024.</li><li>On successful completion of Internships, companies may offer PPOs (Pre-Placement Offers) to the students. PPO offered by the company has to be intimated to the TPC. However, the student is at the liberty of accepting or rejecting the PPO. The concerned student has to express his/her choice to TPC within two working days of receiving the PPO. If he/she accepts the PPO offer, then he/shewill not be allowed to participate in any further on-campus placement activity. As an exception to this, a student with PPO can appear for the placement procedure of a PSU.</li><li>In the best interest of the company, it is advised to send the list of PPOs as early as possible, preferably by the end of October of the next academic session, to prevent the potential students to participate in any on-campus placement activity.</li></ol><a class="btn btn-md btn-primary" href="../media/uploads/internship_policy_company.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to Download the aforementioned Internship Policy (as PDF)</a><p></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="support_form" id="support_form"><div class="controller clearfix " id="controller"><span>Need Help?
